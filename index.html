        <h2>WWW</h2>
        <p>The web is composed largely of HTML documents.
        HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language
        The components of the web include the client (your computer and browser), the Internet, and servers.
        The client and servers interact through something called the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).

        </p>

        <h2>HTML Elements</h2>
        <p>HTML Elements are what we use to tell a web browser how to display content in a web page.
        Most HTML elements consist of an opening and a closing tag with some content between them. The tag b cretaes bold <b>text</b> and the tag em creates <em>italics</em>.

        </p>

        <h2>HTML Attributes</h2>
        <p>Some elements accept additional values called attributes in their opening tags. Attributes provide additional information to the browser. For example, the anchor tag takes an attribute called href that defines a URL to link to.

        a href="url">link Creates a hyperlink to the href attribute value url and names it <a href="url">link</a>.
        Img src="url" alt="text" displays the image hosted at the src attribute value "url" (this can also be a path to a local file on your computer). If the image cannot be displayed, then the alt attribute value "text" is shown.

        </p>

        <h2>More HTML Elements</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>b=bold</li>
            <li>em=italics</li>
            <li>a href= anchor tag for links</li>
            <li>img src=url alt=text images</li>
            <li>br=void</li>
            <li>p=paragraph</li>
            <li>span=inline</li>
            <li>div=block</li>
            </ul>



        <h2>Computers are stuipid</h2>
   	    <p>Programmers often describe computers as "stupid."
        Computers interpret language literally while humans are able to interpret language based on context

   	    </p>

        <h2>Inline vs Block</h2>
    	<p>Block text creates an actual text box around content that can have height and width. Inline elements are just text.
    	</p>

        <h2>Span and div</h2>
    	 <p>Span is inline and div is block and do not do anything other than contain their content.</p>

        <h2>HTML Document Structure</h2>

         <ul>
		 <li>HTML</li>
		 <li>Head</li>
		 <li>Title</li>
		 <li>Body</li>
		</ul>

      <h1>Lesson 2 Notes</h1>

        <h2>Four stages of expertise</h2>
				<p>There are four stages of expertise when learnign anything new. These include novice, awareness, ability, expert. Each one builds on the next one utnil you reach the level of expert and can accopmlish the task by muscle memory without even thinking about it. </p>

			<h2>Make a web page</h2>
				<p>By creating a web page and learning html we will learn what it means to write code. How code is structured and how computers understand the code. We will also learn programming tools and languages. Gain the satisfaction of telling the computer what to do. </p>

			<h2>Creating a structured document</h2>
				<p>Html is language of the web. The basic word is tag and the browser turns tags into elements. It knows how to do this with DOM, document object model. Each tag creates an element in the DOM. To define style you need to use CSS. CSS allows you to use certain syntax and rules to change how elements look on the page. It is easiest to view web pages in terms of boxes, this allows you to visualize it’s structure. </p>

	<h1>Lesson 3 Notes</h1>





					<h2>CSS code</h2>

						<p>You can use CSS code to add style to your page. Don’t repeat yourself-important tip for programming</p>

					<h2>How CSS works and how to use it</h2>

						<p>CSS stands for Cascading style sheets. It is the appearance of the website. You can have several css files for your html. CSS is code written to control the "style" of HTML elements. The selector defines what element of the page the rule will apply to
						.descrption { attribute:value:
						}
						</p>


					<h2>How does CSS "control" HTML?</h2>
						<p>If you want to write CSS that makes all h1 elements have a black background and white text, you would write:
						h1 {
						  background-color : black;
						  color: white;
						}
						In this example, the h1 is a selector. It says to the browser "I want you to apply the rules I'm about to tell you to every h1 element."
						After the h1 there is a left curly brace { and at the bottom there is a matching right curly brace }. Everything between these curly braces will be interpreted as a "rule" that should be applied to every h1 element.
						The line of code that says background-color : black; is a declaration. background-color is a property and black is the value of that property.
						How do I include CSS Styling in my web page?
						There are three ways you can do this.
						Method 1: write CSS in the head of your HTML. This method is good for very small projects.
						Method 2: Link your HTML to a separate CSS file . This adds another step, but it lets you stay more organized when working on larger projects.
						Method 3: Write your style inline with your HTML. This is generally a very bad idea because it leads to lots of repeated code. </p>
